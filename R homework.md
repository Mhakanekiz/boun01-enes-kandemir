### UseR! 2020:Online Scheduling Approach For Distributed Additive Manufacturing Systems

Distributed manufacturing systems represent a new paradigm in the industrial contex such as additive manufacturing,on-demand,smaller-scale and close to final client.Propose and implemented (R) a new conceptual model for dynamic allocation of production orders in DM systems considering data provided by IoT technologies.They get model to deal with model implementation and integration.The model able to deal with stochastic characteristics in dynamic environment considering internal and external information.Shortly,The model was implemented in an open source language and can be easily applied in DM systems considering real time data.

### AirbnB uses R to scale data science

Airbnb is a famously data-driven company, and has recently gone through a period of rapid growth. To accommodate the influx of data scientists (80% of whom are proficient in R, and 64% use R as their primary data analysis language), Airbnb organizes monthly week-long data bootcamps for new hires and current team members.Airbnb has invested in building an internal R package called Rbnb that implements collaborative solutions to common problems, standardizes visual presentations, and avoids reinventing the wheel.

### Every Modern Marketer Needs R Programming

Why should marketers seek out R programming? For starters, it can help them take a deep-dive look at how the details of a predictive model will fit into and support overall their business plans.A second reason that marketers can benefit from R programming is that it comes with a trial data set. Users can type data( ) into the terminal to load a file of data tables.Another advantage is that there are many packages available for R that can help with repetitive tasks such as API calls to databases and other solutions that are specific to business platforms.To summarize,R programming is an open source language used for statistical modeling and data visualization,so every modern marketer needs R programming to improve yourself.
